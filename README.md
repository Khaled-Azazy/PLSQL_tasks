# PL/SQL Project

This project contains two tasks:

Script for deleting all user sequences in a specified schema and building a sequence trigger for all primary keys in the same schema.

Script for converting contracts into a specified number of payments based on the contract conditions.

# Usage
Run the script delete_sequences.sql to delete all user sequences in a specified schema and build a sequence trigger for all primary keys in the same schema.

Run the script contract_installments.sql to convert contracts into a specified number of payments based on the contract conditions.

# Note
Make sure to take care of the first script because it deletes all the sequences in user schema.
